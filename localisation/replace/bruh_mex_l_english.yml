 MEX_focus_gulf_coast_naval_yards:0 "Gulf Coast Naval Yards"
 MEX_focus_gulf_coast_naval_yards_desc:0 "Our Gulf Coast faces Europe and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, our major trade partners. Our growing oil industry would be well served by an expansion of shipyards in Veracruz."
 MEX_focus_pacific_coast_naval_yards:0 "Pacific Coast Naval Yards"
 MEX_focus_pacific_coast_naval_yards_desc:0 "Trade over the Pacific with Japan and California is less important to us than the Atlantic, but we should protect our interests and open up more possibilities. Expanding the Pacific shipyards gives us that much more leeway if the Gulf should become blockaded."
 MEX_focus_brown_water_navy:0 "Brown Water Navy"
 MEX_focus_brown_water_navy_desc:0 "Mexico relies on outdated pre-Great War vessels to protect our trade near the coasts. We have been attempting to buy more modern ships from Spain and other powers, but progress is slow. We need to develop our naval strategies in case war engulfs Europe and spills over to the Western Hemisphere."
 tooltip_escort_ships:0 "Escort Ships"
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy:0 "Blue Water Navy"
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy_desc:0 "Mexico has never been a naval power. In colonial times, our Spanish overlords needed all their ships to face the British. During the independence struggle and civil wars following it, all our attentions were focused inwards. After America overtook us and became a Great Power, there was no point trying to contest the seas. But perhaps in these turbulent times Mexico will need a powerful navy."

 MEX_focus_raiding_navy:0 "Raiding Navy"
 MEX_focus_raiding_navy_desc:0 "We can't hope to catch up with the major naval powers of the world in contesting the surface against battleships and carriers. We should instead try to interdict enemy troop transports before they arrive to protect Mexico from invasion."
 MEX_focus_heroic_military_college:0 "Heroic Military College"
 MEX_focus_heroic_military_college_desc:0 "The Colegio Militar was founded in 1823 and acquired the honorific of Heroico after five of its cadets fought to the death against American Marines during the 1847 Mexican-American war. A sixth cadet wrapped himself in the Mexican flag and hurled himself from the walls to avoid capture."

 MEX_focus_tank_workshops:0 "Tank Workshops"
 MEX_focus_tank_workshops_desc:0 "Our aircraft designer, TNCA, experimented with armored fighting vehicles during the Great War, creating a prototype based on the British rhombus designs. We should restart these experiments and create a tank workshop."
 MEX_focus_weapons_modernisation:0 "Weapons Modernization"
 MEX_focus_weapons_modernisation_desc:0 "Mexico had a fantastic small arms industry before the Revolution. The hated dictator Díaz, for all his faults, was keenly interested in weapons development. The experiments into automatic rifles during the Díaz era need investigation."
 MEX_focus_aviation_workshops:0 "Aviation Workshops"
 MEX_focus_aviation_workshops_desc:0 "The TNCA was mothballed for lack of funds after the Revolution, but with the killing power of aircraft only increasing since then we must stay on top of aeronautical advances."
 MEX_focus_military_aviation_specialists:0 "Military Aviation Specialists"
 MEX_focus_military_aviation_specialists_desc:0 "The Escuela Militar de Mecánicos Especialistas de Aviación will train a corps of skilled technical staff to service our aircraft. The better maintained the aircraft, the longer the pilots have in the air to accrue experience."
 MEX_focus_army_expansion_programme:0 "Army Expansion Program"
 MEX_focus_army_expansion_programme_desc:0 "Mexico has vast capacity for expanding the army, with the nation-building program of the Revolution uniting the self-interested provinces into a single Fatherland. Our patriotic citizens will come to the aid of the state if times are dire."
 MEX_focus_heavy_artillery:0 "Heavy Artillery"
 MEX_focus_heavy_artillery_desc:0 "The killing power of field artillery is undeniable. The Great War showed the world how essential artillery is for supporting advances and breaking up enemy offensives. We must develop our conventional artillery."
 MEX_focus_aerial_artillery:0 "Aerial Artillery"
 MEX_focus_aerial_artillery_desc:0 "We experimented with the use of bombers against 'soft' targets during the Cristero War, and numerous other rebellions by unruly generals. Insurrectionists are unable to contest the skies, and thus bomber support will be essential to safeguarding the Mexican state."
 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank:0 "Agricultural Credit Bank"
 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank_desc:0 "The Banco de Crédito Agricola will help speed up the land reform program by giving loans to ejido farmers with which to buy machinery and other capital goods. Alberto J. Pani is a veteran of the finance industry who can lead this bank and help Mexico expand her productive capacity."
 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure:0 "Rural Infrastructure"
 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure_desc:0 "The rail systems in Mexico were expanded during the Díaz era, but concentrated mostly in the Northern cities so as to facilitate trade with America. We should push the railways further south."
 MEX_focus_peripheral_infrastructure:0 "Peripheral Infrastructure"
 MEX_focus_peripheral_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our most rural regions have seen little improvement in their infrastructure for decades. There are swathes of poverty-stricken subsistence farmers who would become open to factory work and education if we expanded our road systems."
 MEX_focus_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
 MEX_focus_rural_schools_desc:0 "The schools are where we turn the raw material of illiterate peasants into patriotic citizens willing to fight injustice and strengthen the Fatherland. The Escuelas Regionales Campesinas will revolutionize the peasants, teach them technical skills and make them self-reliant."
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze:0 "Rent Freeze"
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze_desc:0 "The urban laborers are a key constituent in the new Mexico we are building. They were mobilized into Red Battalions during the Revolution and now seek the compensation they were promised. One area of immediate concern should be the parasitic landlords extracting rents from these hardworking wealth creators."
 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers:0 "Confederation of Mexican Workers"
 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers_desc:0 "The political elite in Mexico have alway sought to control trades union activities. The CTM will replace the CROM, as the latter is seen as corrupt and discredited by association with unpopular past leaders of the regime."
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias:0 "Ejido Worker Militias"
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias_desc:0 "The land reform promised in the Constitution of 1917 has seen slow progress. Often, landlords use thugs and private armies to intimidate their tenants to prevent redistribution. Let us organize the peasants, farmers and laborers into communal militias to protect the gains we are making against injustice."
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution:0 "Party of the Revolution"
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "President Cárdenas was elected on a platform of agrarian reform thanks to the support of worker and peasant organizations. We have implemented the reforms and now have a proud socialist nation ready to fight injustice on the international stage."
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector:0 "Liberalize the Banking Sector"
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector_desc:0 "There are many heavy-handed government policies preventing the market from transforming Mexico. The 1925 General Law of Credit Institutions, for example, prevents banks from owning shares in other banks. Ridiculous! The freer the market, the freer the people. Luis Montes de Oca, an advocate of the Austrian School of Economics, will help us reform the banking system."
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking:0 "Strike Breaking"
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking_desc:0 "Unionization is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution of 1917, but attacks on property are criminal and should be treated as such. Withdrawing labor from a critical industry could even be perceived as treasonous in a time of crisis."
 MEX_focus_urban_development:0 "Urban Development"
 MEX_focus_urban_development_desc:0 "The cities are the center of economic activity and therefore must have their needs prioritized over the backwards rural states. We will build up the road and rail systems in Mexico City and the other major urban areas, and in doing so the wealth of Mexico will increase even more."
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla:0 "Científico Camarilla"
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla_desc:0 "The Díaz regime was supported by a clique of technocrats in the cabinet and private business. The unpopular clientelism and patronage systems they established were one reason the regime collapsed. However, we have the love and support of the people, and the Científicos have some much needed skills..."
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform:0 "End Land Reform"
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform_desc:0 "The land reform program has long been abused by local strongmen with political connections or military power. A wealthy farmer stealing public land for his own gain doesn't help make Mexico stronger or more united. That land should instead be sold to the highest bidder. Perhaps some landlords do abuse their tenants, but that is a matter for the courts."
 MEX_focus_privatization:0 "Privatization"
 MEX_focus_privatization_desc:0 "The ejido system places restrictions on the use of land, depending upon the use intended by the government. Why should the state force farmers into subsistence rather than growing cash crops for export? We can make Mexico wealthier if we break up the communal farms and allow real development to take place. Antiquated notions of self-reliance only stand in the way of progress and globalization."
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies:1 "Caudillo Private Armies"
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies_desc:0 "The governors, businessmen and garrison commanders in a region tend to be the same man - a Revolutionary general who accrues power by appointing loyal underlings to positions of influence. These caudillos are a fact of life which we should cultivate, not fight against."
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo:0 "Support General Cedillo"
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo_desc:0 "The Northern General Saturnino Cedillo and other caudillos like him need assurances that their autonomy will be respected by the government. The rapid centralization of power under presidents Calles and Cárdenas has allowed us to bring massive weight to bear on the problems facing the nation, so further dispossession of the caudillos is not needed."

 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion:0 "Oil Field Expansion"
 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion_desc:0 "America's need for oil is insatiable. Even though they produce a majority of oil in the world, they import the resource as well. Mexico has undeveloped oil fields up and down the Gulf Coast which we can tap into for exports."
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants:0 "Northern Steel Plants"
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants_desc:0 "The most industrialized region in Mexico outside the capital is the northern border with America. Cities along the Rio Grande such as Matamoros and Ciudad Juarez enjoy close economic ties to their counterparts over the border like Brownsville and El Paso. We should exploit the superior infrastructure in the area to further develop our heavy industries."
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves:1 "Capital Reserves"
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves_desc:1 "The hard cash we raise selling oil is allowing us to flex our economic muscles. If we need to buy technology from America or Britain, for example, we now have the means. We can reverse engineer or mass produce these designs as we see fit."
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment:1 "Oil Revenue Reinvestment"
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment_desc:1 "As we now benefit more from the selling of oil, our budget has quickly increased and we must plan on a useful way to use those new funds. In order to benefit from it in the long run, a reinvestment of those revenues into economic stimulation seems to be the most obvious choice."
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell:0 "Royal Dutch Shell"
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell_desc:0 "Royal Dutch Shell is a British and Dutch firm holding 60% of Mexican oil concessions. By compromising with the foreign oil companies on the matter of labor disputes, we can come to an accomodation that is beneficial to us both."
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations:0 "Community of Nations"
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations_desc:0 "Our economic dependence on British trade need not be a curse. By accepting the status quo we can engage in international diplomacy with the backing of a super power."

 MEX_focus_purchase_belize:0 "Purchase Belize"
 MEX_focus_purchase_belize_desc:0 "This small territory was long claimed by the Spanish crown in colonial times, though never settled by peninsulares. After the loss of Spain's colonial empire during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain gradually solidifed a hold on the territory, culminating in the creation of the colony of British Honduras in 1862. The territory ought to be turned over to Mexico as a gesture of good faith."
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields:0 "Nationalize the Oil Fields"
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields_desc:0 "The foreign oil concessions are dominating the Mexican economy and exerting too much influence over our affairs, both domestic and foreign. The British and Americans pay more attention to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil than to our government!"

 MEX_focus_new_world_order:0 "New World Order"

 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism_desc:0 "Having rightfully reclaimed the natural resources of our country, the foreigners are now clamoring for compensation, but the concessions were essentially stolen from the Mexican people in their time of weakness under the dictator Díaz. Why should we pay a thief for returning stolen property?"
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism:0 "International Proletarianism"
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism_desc:0 "The Soviets have demonstrated that their socialism will transform the planet. The Revolution we fought so hard for was only one step on the road to liberating the people: first of Mexico, and now of the entire world."

 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan_desc:0 "It's true that the Yanquis have a numerical and technological advantage over us, but we have knowledge of the terrain, support from the people, and time and space to establish a strong defense. We will bleed the enemy in the deserts and mountains using hit-and-run tactics, defense-in-depth, and hidden strongpoints."
 MEX_focus_compensation:0 "Compensation"
 MEX_focus_compensation_desc:0 "The oil concessions were legally sold to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil. We cannot fault the foreign firms for seeking a profit. We should maintain the integrity of our legal system by compensating the foreigners for nationalizing the concessions."

 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc:0 "The Americans are now the greatest economic power in history. The Soviets may be fast industrializing, and the Germans may understand war better, but America's advantages are complimented by her insistence upon freedom for the individual and reliance on institutions over brute force. Extending our economic ties to a military alliance would only be natural."

 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta_desc:0 "The Revolution against Díaz and the vicious infighting afterwards lasted a decade. When the dust was settled, the victorious Northern generals met at Agua Prieta, Sonora, to lay out their plan for Mexico's future. They are a populist clique of modernizers and secularizers, or else a 'confederation of caciques' little better than bandit lords dividing their spoils, depending upon one's perspective."
 MEX_focus_exile_calles:0 "Exile Calles"
 MEX_focus_exile_calles_desc:0 "The former president Plutarco Calles served his term between 1924 and 1928. His misrule incited the Cristero War and countless minor rebellions. Now he seeks to dominate President Cárdenas as he controlled the last few puppet presidents. Cárdenas has his own democratic mandate, his own plan for the future, and Calles needs to leave for the sake of the stability of Mexico."

He created the administrations of Portes, Ortiz, Rodríguez and now Cárdenas, and his political enemies castigate him as 'el Jefe Maximo', like some bandit chieftain! In truth, Calles is simply an elderly statesman with only the best intentions for Mexico in mind. Losing him at this stage of the Revolution would be a travesty."

 MEX_focus_arrest_general_cedillo_desc:0 "The caudillos are a menace. They divide Mexico into petty fiefdoms where their appointment of officials gives them power over the economy, military and government. They are looting the wealth of Mexico, and nowhere is this more true than in the province of General Saturnino Cedillo.

 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law_desc:0 "Calles incited the Cristeros to revolt by heavy-handed application of the anti-religious articles of the Constitution. The Calles Law humiliates the clergy by forbidding the wearing of clerical garb in public and imprisonment for religious figures who criticize the government. We agree that the Church's political influence needs curtailing but these are attacks on individual liberty, not Church power."

 MEX_focus_abolish_capital_punishment_desc:0 "The recent instabilities of military rebellion, peasant revolt and the Cristero War, and the government's bloody response to these and to pettier 'crimes', have resulted in an atmosphere of fear pervading Mexico. People can no longer talk freely for fear of being tyrannized by the state. We should phase out capital punishment. By loosening our grip, people will no longer feel compelled to escape it."

 MEX_focus_enforce_the_calles_law_desc:0 "The Cristero footsoldiers may not have been destroyed in the field, but in the years following their futile rebellion we hunted down their remaining leaders and sympathizers within the Church, decapitating their movement and ensuring no resurgence. The Church has no choice but to accept our demands against them. They will become another instrument of the state's power or we will continue decapitating them."

The repression campaign also let us see who had the stomach for messier work."

 MEX_focus_state_education_desc:0 "Socialist education in Mexico means a focus on rationalism and patriotism, rather than adherence to the Pope's dogmas and diktats.

 MEX_focus_antidisestablishmentarianism_desc:0 "The True Faith has been abused by the 'Revolutionary' junta for decades now. Churches, monasteries and reliquaries are formally owned by the state, with clergymen requiring licenses from the government to tend to their flocks.

 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution:0 "Rewrite the Constitution of 1917"
 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Constitution written by the vicious generals places the state above the Church, making marriage a civil act, preventing the clergy from endorsing political candidates, and refusing to recognise the Catholic Church as the source of moral authority in Mexico. We must address these inconsistencies by formally establishing the Catholic Faith as the state religion."

 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage_desc:0 "Many legislators and cabinet ministers of the Revolutionary governments opposed the extension of the right to vote for women because they believed women would be more easily swayed by the arguments of the clergy and would end the program of secularization. Whatever the case in the past, we cannot stand in the path of progress."

 MEX_focus_soldaderas_desc:0 "An iconic part of the Revolution, women soldiers fought in the rank and file and some were promoted to junior officer positions. They were especially important for the logistics of the poorly provisioned Revolutionary armies."

 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias_desc:0 "The left- and right-wing paramilitaries claim to be patriots fighting national traitors, but in truth they are pawns of foreign powers who seek to destabilize the country for nefarious ends. The government must clamp down on the fascist and communist militias."
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army:0 "Depoliticized Army"
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army_desc:0 "The generals have no right to the allegience of their soldiers. The ultimate source of legitimacy is the Mexican state. We should prevent the generals entertaining any thoughts of rebellion by rotating them between provinces so that they cannot build up patronage networks or secure the personal loyalty of their soldiers."
 MEX_focus_professional_army:1 "Escuela Superior de Guerra"
 MEX_focus_professional_army_desc:1 "We cannot rely on ad hoc soldaderas to provision the troops in the field, we need supply depots and a logistics corps. In the Military School our army chiefs and officers will acquire advanced military knowledge that will enable them to develop efficient supply systems. \nAt this point, even donkeys would be an improvement over leaving the troops to forage supplies for themselves."
 MEX_focus_legacy_of_revolution:0 "Legacy of Revolution"
 MEX_focus_legacy_of_revolution_desc:0 "The gains of the Revolution must be defended and national traitors rooted out. The generals are at the forefront of this struggle.

 MEX_focus_the_red_shirts_desc:0 "Governor Tomás Garrido Canabal created the Red Shirts in 1930 to defend the Revolution against the Catholic Church and its reactionary priests.

 MEX_focus_smash_the_bureaucrats_desc:1 "After the death of Lenin, a corrupt bureaucracy led by Stalin has formed a Bonapartist regime in the Soviet Union, stealing power from the toilers. The USSR has therefore devolved into a degenerated worker's state which perverts the ideals of the Revolution."

 MEX_focus_hispanic_alliance_desc:1 "Our rulers are descended from the peninsulares, colonists who brought civilization to the New World. Spain, with her strong tradition of Church power and landed elites, was once a source of legitimacy. Nowadays, Spain looks less and less like the leader of the Latin world. We must take up this mantle for ourselves and create stronger bonds across the continent using our Hispanicity as the building block."
