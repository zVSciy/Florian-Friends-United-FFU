  ### DESCRIPTION ###
  BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1936, Brazil was a republic ruled by President Getúlio Vargas, who had taken power in a coup in 1930. The country was in a period of economic growth and modernization, with the government implementing social welfare programs and expanding infrastructure. However, the government was also authoritarian and suppressed political opposition, with Vargas using his secret police force to quash dissent."
