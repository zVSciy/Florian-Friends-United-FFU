The country had recently undergone a revolution in 1932, which transformed the absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. The Khana Ratsadon, made up of civil servants and military officers, took control of the government and implemented a new constitution. Under the new government, Siam pursued a policy of modernization. The country implemented reforms to education, health, and infrastructure, and also sought to expand its influence in Southeast Asia."
