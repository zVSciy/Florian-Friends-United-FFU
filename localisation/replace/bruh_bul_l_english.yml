  BUL_industrial_expansion:0 "Industrial Expansion"
  BUL_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "Let us make the most of this good fortune and expand our industrial capacity beyond what was previously possible."
  BUL_economic_boom:0 "Economic Boom"
  BUL_economic_boom_desc:0 "This era of prosperity never seems to stop giving! Let us hope these peaceful times never end."

  BUL_farming_modernisation:0 "Farming Modernisation"
  BUL_farming_modernisation_desc:0 "Agricultural autarky may be nothing but a dream, but investing in modern agricultural methods will certainly contribute to a healthier economy."
  BUL_heavy_industry_investments:0 "Heavy Industry Investments"
  BUL_heavy_industry_investments_desc:0 "In terms of heavy equipment, Bulgarian industry is fairly lacking. In the event that we must defend ourselves, it is imperative we establish a baseline level of munitions production."
  BUL_expand_military_production:0 "Expand Domestic Production"
  BUL_expand_military_production_desc:0 "Any guns not produced in Bulgaria must be purchased, increasing our reliance on foreign markets. With tensions rising, perhaps it would be wise to expand our local factories before looking outwards."

  BUL_national_defence_industry_desc:0 "We must greatly expand our national arms industry if we are to keep up with increased demands."

  BUL_reaffirm_territorial_claims:0 "Reaffirm Territorial Claims"
  BUL_reaffirm_territorial_claims_desc:0 "Of the nations that were butchered by the Great War, Bulgaria was cut up fairly badly. The Treaty of Neuilly in 1919 forced us to relinquish all of our rightful conquests, in return for guaranteed access to the Aegean Sea, a stipulation the Entente never fulfilled. If the enemy refuses to uphold their end, then we needn't uphold ours."
  BUL_northern_claims:0 "Northern Claims"
  BUL_northern_claims_desc:0 "Perhaps the most humiliating of our territorial losses was the return of Dobrudja to our longtime rivals, the Romanians."
  BUL_southern_claims:0 "Southern Claims"
  BUL_southern_claims_desc:0 "Broken promises breed bitter feelings. The Allies have none to blame but themselves for this crumbling world. Let us take what is ours."
  BUL_western_claims:0 "Western Claims"
  BUL_western_claims_desc:0 "For the crime of daring too much, Bulgaria was stripped of North Macedonia and Southern Serbia, which were integrated into the failed Yugoslav state. It is never too late for justice."

  BUL_motorisation:0 "Motorise the Army"

  BUL_armour:0 "Armour Experiments"
  BUL_armour_desc:0 "It would be foolish to overlook the impact of armor in recent conflicts. We would do well to imitate these designs."
  BUL_tactical_innovations:0 "Tactical Innovations"
  BUL_tactical_innovations_desc:0 "Modern warfare requires adaptation and revision to succeed. We are not so vain as to believe there is nothing to be gleamed from reflection, and thus we shall rewrite the Art of War in our own ink. This will be Sun Tzu's Director's Cut."
  BUL_special_forces:0 "Bulgarian Special Forces"
  BUL_special_forces_desc:0 "Transforming the Royal Guard into an elite corps of specialized soldiers seems worth a try."
  BUL_new_cavalry:0 "The New Cavalry"

  BUL_german_licenses:0 "German Equipment"
  BUL_german_licenses_desc:0 "Our industry has come far, but there is no shame in utilizing foreign designs for the glory of Greater Bulgaria."
  BUL_german_experts:0 "German Experts"
  BUL_german_experts_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht hosts many brilliant minds. Though they may never reach the Bulgarian level of tactical genius, there are certainly lessons to be gleamed from these great men."
